**What was fixed:**
- Removed hardcoded placeholder number `+1234567890`
- Added SharedPreferences dependency injection for emergency contact storage
- Added `getEmergencyContact()` method to retrieve configured contact
- Added `setEmergencyContact()` method for users to configure their emergency contact
- Added validation to prevent SMS sending to non-existent numbers

**Security improvement:** Prevents life-threatening failures in emergency situations.

### ‚úÖ 3. **Fixed: Unencrypted Sensitive Data Storage**
**Files Fixed:** `BackupManager_with_logging.kt`

**What was fixed:**
- Implemented AES/GCM encryption using Android Keystore
- Changed backup file extension from `.json` to `.enc`
- Added `encryptData()` and `decryptData()` methods
- Added `getOrCreateSecretKey()` for secure key management
- All sensitive medical data now encrypted at rest

**Security improvement:** Protects sensitive medical and personal data from unauthorized access.

## üü° **LOGIC ERRORS - FIXED**

### ‚úÖ 4. **Fixed: Deprecated onBackPressed() Usage**
**Files Fixed:** `SOSActivity.kt`

**What was fixed:**
- Replaced deprecated `onBackPressed()` with `OnBackPressedDispatcher`
- Added `setupBackPressedHandler()` method using `OnBackPressedCallback`
- Moved exit confirmation logic to `showExitConfirmation()` method

**Improvement:** Future-proofs the app for upcoming Android versions.

### ‚úÖ 5. **Fixed: SQL Injection Risk in DAO Query**
**Files Fixed:** `MedicationDao.kt`, `MedicationRepository.kt`

**What was fixed:**
- Changed DAO method parameter from `dayOfWeek: String` to `dayPattern: String`
- Moved pattern creation to repository layer: `val dayPattern = "%${dayOfWeek.name}%"`
- Removed string concatenation in SQL query
- Used parameterized query with `:dayPattern` placeholder

**Security improvement:** Eliminates SQL injection vulnerability.

### ‚úÖ 6. **Fixed: Weak Voice Command Recognition**
**Files Fixed:** `VoiceService.kt`

**What was fixed:**
- Replaced simple string matching with regex pattern matching
- Added negative pattern detection to prevent false positives
- Implemented proper word boundary checking
- Added comprehensive patterns for medication confirmation

**Improvement:** Prevents false medication confirmations from ambiguous speech.

## ‚ö° **PERFORMANCE ISSUES - FIXED**

### ‚úÖ 7. **Fixed: Memory Leak in Medication Reminder Service**
**Files Fixed:** `MedicationReminderService.kt`

**What was fixed:**
- Replaced ongoing `Flow.collect` with `Flow.first()` in `scheduleRecurringReminders()`
- Added proper lifecycle management for Flow collection
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging

**Performance improvement:** Eliminates memory leaks in background services.

### ‚úÖ 8. **Fixed: Inefficient Time Zone Handling**
**Files Fixed:** `MedicationReminderService.kt`

**What was fixed:**
- Replaced `LocalTime.now()` with `ZonedDateTime.now(timeZone)`
- Updated all time calculations to use `ZonedDateTime` and `Duration`
- Added proper timezone handling in `scheduleMedicationReminder()`
- Fixed `getNextOccurrenceDelay()` and `scheduleWeeklyReminders()` methods

**Performance improvement:** Prevents incorrect medication scheduling across time zones.

---

## üíæ **DATA INTEGRITY ISSUES - FIXED**

### ‚úÖ 9. **Fixed: Destructive Database Migration**
**Files Fixed:** `AppDatabase.kt`, `AppModule.kt`

**What was fixed:**
- Removed `.fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` that deleted all user data
- Added proper `MIGRATION_1_2` migration object
- Enabled schema export with `exportSchema = true`
- Added proper migration logic that preserves user data

**Data protection:** Prevents total data loss during app updates.

### ‚úÖ 10. **Fixed: Non-Atomic Backup Restoration**
**Files Fixed:** `BackupManager_with_logging.kt`

**What was fixed:**
- Wrapped database operations in `database.withTransaction {}`
- Added `parseAndValidateBackup()` method for pre-validation
- Implemented atomic restore that either succeeds completely or fails safely
- Added comprehensive error handling and rollback protection

**Data protection:** Ensures backup restoration doesn't leave app in corrupted state.

---

## üîê **MISSING PERMISSION CHECKS - FIXED**

### ‚úÖ 11. **Fixed: Missing Runtime Permission Check in Voice Service**
**Files Fixed:** `VoiceService.kt`

**What was fixed:**
- Added `hasRecordAudioPermission()` method
- Added permission check in `startListening()` before accessing microphone
- Added proper error handling for missing permissions
- Added required imports for permission checking

**Security improvement:** Prevents crashes and unauthorized microphone access.
